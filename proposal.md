We are interested in the Fast-RRT(Rapidly exploring Random Trees); Multi-Agent Path Finding algorithm; and maybe A* pathfinding algorithm. Fast-RRt is an improved algorithm for RRT which is an algorithm designed to make connections between a randomly spawned node (X_rand) in the state space and a node in a tree that is closest to X_Rand. The multi-agent path finding algorithm is an approach to efficiently find collision free paths for multiple agents. The A* pathfinding algorithm is a heuristic based technique to efficiently find the hottest path between two points by systematically exploring and evaluating paths based on their cost and an estimated distance to the goal. These algorithms should help us find our paths fast and efficiently. We will apply our algorithms to the METAL data in the state of Florida.
